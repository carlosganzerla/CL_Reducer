# CL Reducer
Implementation of a Combinatory Logic (**SKI** calculus) reducer in F#. It finds the weak normal form of combinatory logic terms (CL terms), by a series of weak reductions.

## Known Issues
Inputting terms without a normal form (such as Y combinators) will cause an infinite loop. This will be solved in the near future.
